 Primary coil outside diameter (inches)=      1.150
 Number of primary coil turns =      2.000
 Wire diameter (inches)=      .5000

 Solenoidal Secondary Coil Geometry
 Secondary coil diameter (inches)=     2.000
 Secondary coil height (inches)=       .025
 Number of secondary coil turns =    40.000
 Secondary coil wire diameter (inches)=      .3500

 Calculational Results
 Primary coil inductance in microhenries:  Lp =             .24
 Secondary coil inductance in microhenries:  Ls =          269.06
 Figure of Merit (square root of Ls/Lp) =     33.23
 Primary coil wire length in feet =        .56
 Secondary coil wire length in feet =      20.94
 DC secondary resistance in ohms:       .00
 Secondary coil distributed capacitance in picofarads:      5.08
 (Medhurst formula, assumes one end of secondary is grounded)

 Mutual Inductance Results
 Position is the secondary coil bottom wire position in inches
 above the bottom wire of the primary coil.
 A negative value means the bottom wire of the
 secondary is below the bottom wire of the primary.
 A positive value means that the bottom wire of the
 secondary is above the bottom wire of the primary coil.
 M = Mutual Inductance in microhenries
 K = Coefficient of Coupling: K =  M / square root ( Lp x Ls )
